Meter - Display values in an analog style meter.

The default is the equivalent of a 0.0 to 5.0 volt meter.
The input is 0 - 255, typical Arduino output for the 0 - 5 volt range.
See: Default_No_Hardware or Arduino_5_Volt examples.
No external hardware is required if viewing data from Processing code.

Processing code to access Arduino data examples are included with the
Arduino_5_Volt and Multi_Sensor_Input examples. That code is taken from
examples by Tom Igoe.

The other examples show how to modify the Meter.
The meter is either a half circle or full circle when created:
m = new Meter(this, x, y, true/false);
x and y are the meter upper left corner.
true/false creates a full/half circle meter.

Make any changes immediately following the creation of a Meter class object
in setup().
Important!! if changing the size of the meter, make that the first change,
setMeterWidth(int size). The height of the meter is calculated to accomodate
the new width.

When changing what the meter displays:
The scale labels are what the user sees. They rotate clockwise, starting from zero degrees (3:00 Oclock) to 360 degrees (again at 3:00 Oclock). The default
meter is 180 degrees (9:00 Oclock) to 360 degrees (3:00 Oclock).
The long tic marks point to each scale label. On a full circle meter, such as the Full_Circle_Meter example, the first and last scale labels will overlap.
This is necessary to correctly calculate the spacing. Use the 
setDisplayLastScaleLabel(false) to not have them overlap on the meter.

setMinScaleValue(0.0) and setMaxScaleValue(5.0) would be for scale labels
from 0.0 to 5.0. These Methods are used instead of looking at the first and
last scale labels to allow unrelated values. See the Full_Circle_Compass example. Note in that example the compass is counter clockwise.

These values correspond to the interger input to the meter,
updateMeter(int newSensorReading). setMinInputSignal(0) and 
setMaxInputSignal(255) for the default meter.

So it is input signal range which is translated to the scale value range
that corresponds to the scale labels.

Use setUp(int minInputSignal, int maxInputSignal,
		float minScaleValue, float maxScaleValue,
		float arcMinDegrees, float arcMaxDegrees);
as an easy alternative to the above six individual calls.

After that, there are a few options that may be of interest, in no particular
order.
The digitalMeterValue can be displayed at the bottom of the meter.
This area is called the informationArea. As with almost everything else, the font, color, size, text, etc. can be changed. See the other examples. 
GetDefaultValues and SetAllValues will display the initial default values and demonstrate how to make the desired changes.

The maximum and minimum values obtained so far, can also be displayed in the
informationArea. They use the same font as defined by the informationArea but
have individual options as well. Note that only one value can be displayed at
a time, maximumValue, minimumValue, or digitalMeterValue. The maximum and
minimum needles can be displayed at any time.

High and low warnings can be set, with different colors on the meter arc. There are also warning messages that will be displayed.

There is an enableInputSignalOutOfRange option with its own message if that
condition is possible.

The displayWarningMessagesToOutput can be used to disable any messages to
the output display.

MouseDirectionVelocityAcceleration example demonstrates what can be displayed
without microprocessor input. Please excuse any physics mistakes in the example. It was ment to show uses of the Meter and not my very ancient high school physics class memory. (Thanks to Daniel Shiffman and his examples.)
