The AnalogInOutSerialToProcessing sketch demonstrates how to
access data (voltage level) from an Arduino microprocessor and 
feed the data to the Meter Processing sketch. See the Processing 
sketchbook example Arduino_5_Volt.

The Multi-SensorToProcessing sketch demonstrates using
multiple sensor inputs to a Meter Processing sketch:
voltage, temperature, and humidity. This sketch uses the
DHT Temperature & Humidity Sensor library for Arduino,

developed by Rob Tillaart, Version: 0.1.14.
It is here for convenience. Check for a newer version.
